A Lisp bundle for TextMate.

- `Ctrl+h` searches the HyperSpec using the current word (clicking goes to the appropriate section)
- `Cmd+r` executes the current script (see `Bundles > Lisp > Help` for more information on this)
- There are currently snippets for `defconstant`, `defmacro`, `defparameter`, `defun`, `defvar`, `if`, `let`, and `setf`

This bundle is mainly by Zoetrope, originally found [here](http://zoetrope.speakermouth.com/2008/4/9/lisp-bundle-for-textmate), I (dbr) have added the "Run Script" command, and fixed up "Documentation For Current Word" to use the LispWorks HyperSpec (as the www.lisp.org one seems to have disappeared)
